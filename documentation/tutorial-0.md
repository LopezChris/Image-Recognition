# Building a Image Recognition Application

## Introduction

You will learn to run TensorFlow on a single machine and train a simple classifier to classify images of flowers.

### Big Data Technologies used to develop the Application:

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

### Goals and Objectives

- Ability to use Python and Tensorflow to retrain an image classifier
- Ability to classify images with your trained classifier

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Linux commands
- Installed Docker on your local host machine
- Installed Virtual Machine Software

## Outline

1\. **Application Development Concepts**: You will be introduced to image recognition and model retraining fundamentals.

2\. **Retraining Models for Object Recognition**: You will setup the development environment with TensorFlow, then learn to retrain the model for object recognition. This process can be used for classification of elephant species, flowers, etc.
